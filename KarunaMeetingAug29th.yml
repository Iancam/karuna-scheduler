info:
  - launch date: sept 15th


backend: 
  jonathan:
    - twilio dialog flow:
      - flows triggered through cell
      - upgrade allows multiple users to use
      - scheduler works
      - flows will be repeated, upgrading a flow takes a lot of work
      - changing flows day to day is not scalable
      - todos:
        - update these
        - authenticate from dialog flow to auth point: pain point
      - implementation is possible, but won't have time to test though
      - using cron, authentication is involved,
      - can be triggered with 'run x' from your cell phone
  ian:
    - helping out on the scheduler component
  eric: 
    - main priority is getting the pipeline up by end of weekend
    - set up a central number for dialog flow, 
    - co-pilot assures a consistent phone, load balance across numbers

front-end: 
  aakash:
    - upload historical data that didn't come from the pipeline:
      - personal csv added to the repo?
    - performance hit given the amount of data for timeScale information
  eric:
    - clara(themes analysis) -> visualization
    - hovering over the specific bubble
    - bubble click == sidebarOpen
  jonathan:
    - firestore?
    - firebase connected in the browser (ross)
  harsh:
    - component for not enough data (community_data.length < 10)

several flows:
  - scheduler for each of these 
  - eg:
    - social
    - login
  putting a schedule on different days:
    - same flow each day of the week
deener questions:
  
  - also a standard question (how was your day?)
  - flows loop monthly
  - slip these into the user questions instead of the standard
